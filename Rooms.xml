        <story_text>
        You are 27 and a huge fan of the arcades and have been since you were a kid. There is something nostalgic about placing your quarter on the console as you wait to play next. Playing as long as you can on one quarter, and entering the initials SAM when you get high score.

        You Google arcades in your area, and find only one, Flynn's Arcade.  There have been some crazy stories about this place and the owners, stuff you would only see in the movies.  It was closed for a long time, but now is flourishing.

        You park and walk to the front doors. You remember all the games you used to play, the adrenaline rushes through you as you place your hand on the door.  Are you ready?</story_text>

        <story_text>
        As you enter Flynn's Arcade it all comes back to you.  You feel 7 years old again.  Back to when your dad would take you to play, telling you about the Grid and how to play the games.

        You notice that each game is accented with a specific light and for a moment you can do nothing but take in the lights and sounds the prizes,  and then . . . . you play!

        What game do you want to play first?</story_text>

        <story_text>A small, neon purple gaming terminal appears in front of you. It looks exactly like a normal arcade game, but pixelated. On the screen appears a familiar theme--a long snake eating a block, however the snake's body looks distorted. There are controllers beneath the screen.

            After grabbing the controllers, you hear the same sounds that warped all around you before! You close your eyes in fear, and when you open them you see a familiar block in the distance. The snake is nowhere to be seen! You take one step forward to get a better look and you slither! Looking down in disbelief, you are completely purple. You have become the snake!</story_text>

        <story_text>You attained the two most valuable prizes in the arcade. The owner wants you to leave now.
            A large, pixelated golden door appears in front of you.

            You push open the door, and a bright white light blinds you. You rub your eyes, and when you open them, you are staring at the screen of the mysterious machine in the arcade. This time, the screen is now showing Frogger and Snake working as usual. You hear a coin drop below into the coin return panel. You grab the coin and look at it. This is the quarter you used to pay for the game, however one side of the quarter displays a glitched Frogger and the other side displays a glitched Snake. YOU WIN!!</story_text>
